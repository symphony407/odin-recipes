The Recipe Book

This is a small recipe book to demonstrate what I have learned using HTML and CSS. This project displays multiple recipes, each with a list of ingredients and step-by-step instructions.  

The home page displays the recipes available, and after a recipe is clicked, the screen switches to that recipe's page.

Technologies Used: 
HTML5, CSS3, FlexBox, CSS Grid, Git/GitHub, VS Code

Major features that were implemented were semantic HTML elements to help with accessibility and readability. Fonts and accent styles were implemented across the website to improve its appeal, while adhering to a more general color scheme. The project was also centralized on the screen instead of being on the default left side. 

Another major feature implemented was adding reusable recipe cards to the index page. Each card contains the recipe's title, a view recipe button, and the recipe's image. Also, the buttons to navigate between the recipe pages and the homescreen are now styled the same.

In the future, I would like to add page animations and a dark mode.

This was a great project to help me improve on my Flexbox skills, as well as learning Grid.
